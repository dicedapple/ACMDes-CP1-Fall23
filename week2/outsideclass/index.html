        <h1>Interesting Takeaways from 2 Readings</h1>

        <br>
        <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2>

        <p class="red big">Quote One</p>
        <p class="red">“Is google.com a good website because of the look of the search field?”</p>
        <p class="red big">Response</p>
        <p class="red">I feel this is how I originally felt in the early stages of my BA. A site is good due to its design, not understanding that so many other variables need to be considered.</p>

        <p class="red big">Quote Two</p>
        <p class="red">“However, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”</p>
        <p class="red big">Response</p>
        <p class="red">Agreed. I have felt this “digital reality” coming for quite some time. Hence my movement out of textile/fashion design and into a space where I can keep up with new advances in technology more easily.</p>

        <p class="red big">Quote Three</p>
        <p class="red">“Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.”</p>
        <p class="red big">Response</p>
        <p class="red">In my current role I still come across designers feeling as though once they throw their designs “over the wall” to development it isn't their role to work with development to ensure its implemented correctly. “Design QA”. And also iterating after a product release is where the true product comes to life…not the MVP.</p>

        <h2>What do Prototypes Prototype</h2>

        <p class="red big">Quote One</p>
        <p class="red">“Designers evaluate their options with their own team by critiquing prototypes of alternate design directions. They show prototypes to users to get feedback on evolving designs. They show prototypes to their supporting organizations (such as project managers, business clients, or professor(s) to indicate progress and direction.”(Pg. 2)</p>
        <p class="red big">Response</p>
        <p class="red">A good breakdown of the many use cases of prototypes. I never really thought about it in this context.</p>

        <p class="red big">Quote Two</p>
        <p class="red">“Ironically, while the design team understood the meaning of the hand-drawn graphics, other members of the organization became enamored with the sketchy style to the extent that they considered using it in the final artifact. This result was entirely at odds with the original reasons for making a rough-looking prototype. This example shows how the effectiveness of some kinds of prototypes may be limited to a specific kind of audience.”(Pg. 7)</p>
        <p class="red big">Response</p>
        <p class="red">I have actually had this happen. I did rough mock ups (mid fidelity x mid resolution) in which would land somewhere between “look and feel and role”. The audience viewed it without my knowledge and considered it a final artifact in which they wanted to move on quickly…</p>

        <p class="red big">Quote Three</p>
        <p class="red">“Since they may need to be as complex as the final artifact, they are the most difficult and time consuming kinds of prototypes to build.” (Pg. 12)</p>
        <p class="red big">Response</p>
        <p class="red">I frequently have to built this type of prototype in my current role. Connecting the dots between a plethera of other prototypes from other domains to make sense of the product in its entirety.</p>
