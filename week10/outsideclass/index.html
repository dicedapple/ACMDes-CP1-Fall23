        <p class="red">I attempted to recreate this but had the idea to put a smaller generative circle within the other. However, I could not figure out how to do it... <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1824774" target="_blank">Check it out here!</a> I felt like I might have been moving to fast and took a step back. I played around with time and oscillation last week and this time around tried to further de-syncronize the pattern, shape, and movement of it. I was very confused on how to implement Perlins noise with two shapes.</p> <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/p5Zovie/sketches/5JpIQJ9Nm" target="_blank">Link to p5.js Editor Code</a>

        <p class="red">I felt like I might have been moving to fast and took a step back. I played around with time and oscillation last week and this time around tried to further de-syncronize the pattern, shape, and movement of it. I was very confused on how to implement Perlins noise with two shapes. I tried for hours but could not get it to look "organic". Defintely one of the more challenging projects we've had.</p>
