        <p class="red">I attempted to use flocking to move my "alienships" around the screen. However, in doing so I could not get my "Humanship" to shoot its laserbeam at the alien ships. Here is an example of the swarm/flocking that I attemped.<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-flocking.html" target="_blank">Check it out here!</a> Here is as far as I got with the exercise. I fully understand how I got here, however, once here I could not seem to get very creative with it. I referenced my UML document as well while building the story.</p> <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/p5Zovie/sketches/htAEJTTI3" target="_blank">Link to p5.js Editor Code</a>
