        <h1>Creating a GEM Dashboard in Week 7</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p class="red big">Went for it on my own</p>
        <p class="red">I didn't end up using a tutorial to build this, at least so far! I learned a lot in the Lego Minifig build that I did prior and displayed my knowledge here. I'm still going to add buttons, and a fw more details but I purposely do not want to add color to it. I want it to stay as a "clay" model. </p>
        <p class="red big">My Learnings</p>
        <p class="red">Keeping track of where I am at is a lot easier than when I started. Having the use of front, and side angles, etched into my brain really helped me understand how to build proportiately. </p>
        <p class="red big">Photos</p>
        <p class="red">I took screenshots of the my progress so far below!</p>
